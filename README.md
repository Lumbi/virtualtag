Augmented reality graffiti iOS app

The app let's the user take a picture of anything and use it as a target for computer vision recognition (as long as it has enough visual features). 
The user can then draw a simple drawing (similar to Snapchat) on top of the picture and posts it. The drawing and target are saved along with the geolocation. 

Later, other users can start the camera to view the drawing in AR above the target registered by the original user.

I also made a Node.js backend to manage users and tags in MongoDB.
